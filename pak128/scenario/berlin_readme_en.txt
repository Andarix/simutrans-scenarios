Game Description:

We write June 13, 1961. The Government of East-Berlin built last night
a wall around West Berlin to protect its own people. Don't even think
about crossing the border by land, sea or air! Tunnels are also
not allowed. Caution they are armed.

In prominent areas, the East-Goverment has espand the wall very wide.
There are border stations (public station) for the Movement between 
East- and West-Berlin which allow only buses. An extension of this
stations is not allowed, however, a upgrade of the stops is possible.

At the site (marked 'Bahnhof Friedrichstrasse') a train-station with
border traffic is allowed. Crossing the border south of 'Charite' 
as allowed as a railway bridge. One underground connection for
a North-South axis to the west is also possible. All western trains 
may ONLY on 'Bahnhof Friedrichstrasse' hold.

Because of political pressure were already tracks from Hamburg and 
Frankfurt placed to the city limits of West-Berlin. These are available 
for free. However, when riding the train through the border station
(as a 'transit' marked), insert an additional stop.

For air travel there are in West-Berlin, unfortunately very bad
obtained airports Tegel and Tempelhof available. In East-Berlin the 
local air force supports one military airport, which should my be
uses carfully.

The cities Hamburg and Frankfurt may only be connected to West-Berlin.
Likewise the cities of Warsaw and Prague with East-Berlin. The airports 
of Rome and Oslo, can get a connection only from West- OR(!) East-Berlin.

Feel free to built up a network in East- or/and West-Berlin. The 
interconnection of networks, if required, can only mentioned border
stations carried.

On November 9, 1989 the wall was teared down. The Roadblocks are the 
property of Simutrans-Player, remove this immediately to get a open
border. Unless you have earned enough money you can tear down the wall.
You can also remove the wall and the fence around the site STASI.
Note: An element of the wall can cost up to 100,000 E.

Now try to connect the subnets from the East- and West-Berlin to a 
well working network. In addition, try to make at the mark 
'Berlin HBF (future)' the new central train station.

Build up to the mark 'Simutrans headquarter' your big companies
Headquarter. Since the government of germany has decided to move 
to Berlin build new government buildings (keyboard shortcut "&") and
characterizing them with a marker. At Potsdamer Platz you can
build also new huge buildings. Place all newly built building 
to a heritage (just buy them).

save your game shortly before November 9, 1989 and on the time of your 
end of the game, so that you can post your results to the forum.
